ML Portfolio of implementations for my reference

## Disclaimer
This repository is a collection of implementations of various machine learning algorithms and techniques. 
The implementations are for educational purposes and are not intended to be used in production environments. 
The implementations are not optimized for performance or efficiency. 
The primary goal of this repository is to have sample implementations for reference that I wrote myself to improve understanding.
