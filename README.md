# ML
ML Portfolio of implementations for my reference

## Disclaimer
This repository is a collection of implementations of various machine learning algorithms and techniques. 
The implementations are for educational purposes and are not intended to be used in production environments. 
The implementations are not optimized for performance or efficiency. 
The primary goal of this repository is to have sample implementations for reference that I wrote myself to improve understanding.

# What is Machine Learning?

My take is that ML is a set of statistical methods that are used to represent patterns in data.

The term "Learning" is a bit of a misnomer. 
It's not *exactly* like a human learning. 
It's more like *finding* a function that maps inputs to outputs.
So really the field should be called "Machine Searching" but that doesn't sound as cool.

## Types of Machine Learning
Here I will list links to different files in the repo that fit into the main buckets of ML.

### Regression

[Linear Regression](./lin-reg-torch/lin-reg-torch.py)
[Neural Nets](./nn-torch/nn-torch.py)

### Classification
[Logistic Regression](./log-reg-torch/log-reg-torch.py)
[Neural Nets](./nn-torch/nn-torch.py)

### The others....
