# Method
[Support Vector Machines SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) are a group of classification algorithms that find 
a decision boundary that separates the data into different classes. 
The decision boundary is defined by a set of points called support vectors.

These methods evolved from what are known as maximum margin classifiers.
Which solve a linear program to find a hyperplane that separates the data with the largest margin possible 
given some budget of misclassifications. [See The following LP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Soft-margin)


# Running the code
Ensure the requirements are installed (see requirements.txt in the root project directory).

```bash
cd ../svm # Change to the directory containing the code from the root project directory
python svm.py
```

# Results
