# ðŸ“Š Data Visualization

## Overview

This directory contains scripts and notebooks for visualizing data in support of machine learning workflows.  
These visualizations help to:

- Understand the underlying structure and distribution of the data
- Identify patterns, outliers, and correlations
- Communicate insights and model performance to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Purpose

Developing a machine learning model is only part of the deliverable. Equally important is demonstrating that:

- The model is learning from meaningful patterns in the data  
- It generalizes well to unseen examples  
- Its predictions are interpretable and aligned with stakeholder goals  

This module supports that process through clear and focused visualizations that help build confidence in your models.

## Contents

- `visualize_data.py`: A script for generating visualizations of the dataset, including distributions, correlations, and feature importance.

## Included Visuals

They say a picture is worth a thousand words. That is especially true in data science.

- `./wine_plot.pdf` : A pairplot of the wine dataset, showing the distribution of features and their relationships.
- `./iris_plot.pdf` : A single plot that encapsulates the entire iris dataset, showing the distribution of features and their relationships.
